            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Had we liued then we had knowne leſse then they, and were they liuing now, they would know more then we: euery thing hath his time,
<pb facs="tcp:4422:5"/>before it come to maturity: neither doth nature alot like time to euery like action: ſome things grow to perfection in a moment, when others require a moneth. The Beare bringeth forth in foure weekes, when the Dolphin hath neere <hi>40.</hi> when one fruite faileth, another entreth into ſeaſon: we muſt firſt inuent, next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and lastly perfect: the furtherance of which perfection it behoueth euery louer of the Science to cheriſh, which is here freely offered vnto thy view, though it might haue beene vndertaken (I confeſſe) by ſome one of more experience: but he that moſt can, leaſt will, and he that worst may, holds the candle: elſe the world muſt walke in darkneſſe. There be many ſay, the inſtruments be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and this or that is better: but none ſeeketh to reforme the ſame, &amp; contriue one that ſhall do beſt: the profeſſors themſelues cry out at the erros, but ſeeke no reformation of the fault: ſo that it fareth with this, as in the ciuill actions of the life, euery man curſeth exceſſe, yet none liue temperately: euery man praiſeth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, yet none will ſuffer euery man blameth ſloth, yet none will take paines: euery one exclaimeth on enuy, yet none leaue emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. But to remit this, and ſpeake ſomething of the application of Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>He then that will be ſeene in the knowledge of Geometricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, must learne by contemplation, to frame his propoſition, and by action to manage his instrument: for I know diuers great Scholers, deeply ſeene in the Theoricall part, though in the actiue, meere nouices: which is a cauſe that ſuch, ſo learned, were neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to correct and amend many defects. For as meditation cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ability to vnderſtand, ſo action bringeth dexterity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, becauſe the euent of the worke is illuſtrated by a preciſe obſeruation, as the life of the propoſition is illuminated by a plaine demonſtration: for as points found lines, lines ſurfoces, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces bodies, ſo good inſtruments produce true obſeruations, true obſeruations Symmetricall figures, and the ſuperficiall capacity of propoſed platformes. And as lines bound figures, ſo hedges bound incloſures: and angles in the field are created by the meting of hedges, as they be in figures by the ſection of lines: for you ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:4422:5"/>know that all inſtruments, of what kinde ſoeuer, if they cannot obſerue the preciſe quantitity of the angle, their worke is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: for though ſome instruments expreſſe the quantity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, as the <hi>Theodelitus. &amp;c.</hi> and others regard not the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, producing angles <hi>Homogeneall,</hi> as the <hi>Plaine Table:</hi> yet, if you faile in the one or the other, your concluſion is error: for it is as great an abſurdity if the angle <hi>Homogeneall Mechanicall</hi> delineated vpon the <hi>Plaine Table,</hi> Proue <hi>Heterogeneall,</hi> and accord not Symmetrially to the reſpondent angles in the field, as if with a graduated inſtrument you had falſly obſerued the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof: and therefore it is childiſh vanity, or at leaſt ſelfe conceit, to go about to prefer the <hi>Plaine Table</hi> before a large gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated inſtrument, and I am perſwaded all good Geometricians wil argue the ſame: though I verily beleeue it is poſsible to ſeparate fire from heate, or the earth from the center, at turne the obſtinate will of the ignorant: for vſe and cuſtome hath taken ſuch roote in ſuch, that it will hardly be ſupplanted. It ſufficeth them, plaine men to haue an Inſtrument, for then they preſume they bee <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometritians.</hi> Euery horſe is not <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> yet he may be are one a iourney, though hee bee long and lame in performing it, and can hardly paſſe ouer a mountaine: but let euery man vſe his will, and ſo I will mine heere, in ſaying no more at this time: onely wiſhing my ſelfe preſent to open any thing that the yong practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer ſhall doubt of.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. To know how much one Hill or Mountaine doth exceed an other in height.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His matter is not ſo eaſily performed, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinarily thinke it to be, for to ſeeks how much one hill is higher then another, is not to ſtand vpon the top of one of the hils, and by your Inſtrument finde whether the other bee higher or lower then the leuell of your eye, as in the <hi>19.</hi> Chapter, and ſo to iudge him higher or lower then the hill you be one. But hee that will know how much one hill doth excéede another in height, muſt finde how much both of the ſummities of each hil is diſtant from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> center of the earth: or at leaſt, how much either of their perpendicular al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes excéede the Semidiameter of the earth: for the leſſer of this exceſſe taken from the greater, leaueth the difference of the mountaines perpendicular altitude. For you muſt imagine, what hill ſoeuer you ſtand vpon, beholding another adiacent mountaine <hi>20.</hi> or <hi>30.</hi> miles diſtant, which albeit that hill you behold be equall in height with that whereon you ſtand, yet ſhal he not ſéeme ſo, nor fall out to be ſo, being proued with an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or line of leuell: for that where you ſtand is alwaies the vppermoſt place, the other hill being ſituate as it were vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſide of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, which we may proue by a Philoſophical Axiome: <hi>Omne graue fertur deorſum ad centrum, vbi quieſcit,</hi> inſomuch that if you trauell about the earth with a line and plumbe at the end thereof, the plumbe will alwaies point towards the center, ſo that the exceſſe of any mountaines altitude aboue the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall conuexity of the earth is altered (in reſpect of our ſight) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the poſition of the place: and therefore when you bee aſked concerning the height of two hils, you muſt know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they meane in reſpect of the poſition of the hils, according to the apprehenſion of your ſight, or in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwelling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, aboue the true conuexity of the earth, for you muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the earth is imagined to be round, as a globe, and ſo by ſome it is thought that it was at the firſt creation, and that theſe mountaines and hils were ſince made at <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, by the raging of the water, which forced ſtones, trées, and earth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4422:40"/>diuers heapes, and thereby did irregulate the globous body of the earth, the which albeit being compared to the Spheares in in the heauens (by the conſent of moſt Philoſophers) is but as a point hauing no ſenſible magnitude, yet to vs that inhabite vpon the ſuperficies of the ſame, the very hils haue an apparant and great magnitude, eleuating themſelues aboue the true cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the earth, and as theſe hills are much aboue the true ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the earths circular conuexily: ſo is it not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that many valleyes fall within, and lower then the ſaid circular conuexity, ſo that ſometimes we may bee diſtant more then the earths ſemidiameter from the center, as being vpon a mountaine, and ſometimes leſſe, as in ſome kinde of déepe val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, all which you ſhall bée taught to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To performe what is ſaid before, you muſt aſcend vnto the top of one of the propoſed hils, which let bee <hi>b,</hi> let the other hill bee <hi>c,</hi> and you deſired to tell which of the top of the hilles is the higher: that is, whether <hi>b</hi> or <hi>c</hi> be furtheſt diſtant from <hi>a</hi> the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth. Being therefore at <hi>b,</hi> (by ſome Inſtrument de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this booke) get the angle <hi>c b a 87,</hi> degrées, then muſt you go to the hill <hi>c,</hi> and there againe get the angle <hi>b c a, 74.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, and ſo adding theſe two angles together, you haue <hi>161.</hi> which taken from <hi>180.</hi> leaueth <hi>19.</hi> the angle <hi>c a b</hi> made at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth. Hauing theſe thrée angles, get their ſignes, and finally the diſtance of the two hils <hi>c b,</hi> ſo haue you a line known, and thrée angles knowne, and thereby (as you be often taught) get the ſide <hi>a c,</hi> and <hi>a b,</hi> which note: for, looke which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that hill may you conclude the higher, which heere is <hi>c a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to get the height of <hi>b</hi> or <hi>c,</hi> aboue the true circular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uexity of the earth, ſubtract <hi>34364/11.</hi> from the liue <hi>b a,</hi> ſo haue you the height of the hill <hi>b d</hi> foure ſcore: doe ſo to <hi>c a,</hi> ſo (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake) haue you the height of the hill <hi>c e,</hi> ſeuen ſcore aboue the true circular conuexity of the earth.</p>
               <p>If you ſeeke how much the one hill is higher then the other, then take <hi>b d 4,</hi> from <hi>c e 7:</hi> ſo haue you thrée ſcore, and ſo much is the hill <hi>c e</hi> higher then <hi>b d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here it is apparent, that if you ſtand at <hi>b,</hi> and by a line of leuell looke towards <hi>c,</hi> your ſight will run to <hi>f,</hi> aboue <hi>c,</hi> ſo that the lower hill by this meanes will ſéeme the higher: for you muſt note that <hi>euery line of leuell doth make right angles

               <p>But if you would make experience of the height of hils onely by a leuell, your beſt way is to finde out a third hill alike, or néere a like diſtance from both the other hils, &amp; ſo may you more truly iudge of both their heights, and alſo of the difference thereof from the top of that hill, euen as you bee directed by your line of leuell paralell to the Horizon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIIII. To know if water will run vnto any appointed place.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you deſire to know if water will be brought from any ſpring head vnto any appointed place, you are firſt to conſider how, and in what you meane to bring it: that is, either by trenches and gutters, or in pipes of lead, or ſuch like: for thoſe waters that will come in pipes of lead, will not alſo come in gutters, becauſe the pipes may bring the water into a valley, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey the ſame againe vp ouer the top of any hill, being not higher then the originall ſpring: yea if it bee higher, euen though you ſhould fetch it at the bottome of an hill, vpon the one ſide, and bring it ouer the top of the ſaid hill as low vpon the other ſide: for if you once can ſet it running, it will neuer ceaſſe vntill the pipes be burſt, or all the water ſpent, the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>non poteſt eſſe vacuum in rerum natura.</hi> And for a familiar example: Take a number of quilles cut off at both ends, and ioine them cloſe together with waxe in a circular faſhion, and put the one end thereof into a veſſel that hath water in the bottome, let the other hang ouer the veſſell brims, the lower the better, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth if ſo the one end of the quilles bee as lowe as the other. Now if with your breath you draw the water into your mouth through theſe quilles, and ſo take your mouth thence, the water will run through the ſaid quilles vntill all be ſpent in the veſſel: and this experience confirmes their opinion well that ſay: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua aſcendit, quantum deſcendit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to know if water will come in pipes, after the ordinary faſhion to any appointed place, you muſt firſt know, that the ground whereupon the pipes lye, muſt be lower at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miles end, by 4 ½ inches then it is at the ſpring head: which conſidered, plant your Glaſſe at the ſpring head, ſo that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of the Demicircle lye paralell to the Horizon, and equall in height to the head of the ſpring, the two ſights in the ends of of the Diameter, looke through the ſame to the place whither the water ſhould runne, taking notice of what your eye appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends through the ſights, for to that place will the water runne,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4422:42"/>abating 4 ½ inches for euery mile the Tower is diſtant from you.</p>
               <p>But ſay there be certaine hils betwixt the head of the ſpring and the place wherto the water ſhould runne, in ſuch a caſe you muſt plant your <hi>Glaſſe</hi> at the head of the ſpring as before, and looking through the ſight, note ſome marke in the next hill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place, then go vnto that marke, and if yet you cannot ſée to the place, obſerue ſome other marke in an other hill, and ſo foorth, vntill from the laſt marke you may perceiue the appointed place, in which make a note for abating, as before, the water will runne thereunto.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4422:42"/>I plant my</hi> Glaſſe <hi>in ſome part of the hill, ſo that the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſemicircle lye paralell, and in an equall heigth with the cundit head</hi> a: <hi>the Inſtrument thus planted, look againe through the ſights towards the Tower, and for that there is no other hill betwixt your ſight and the ſame, therefore through the ſight eſpy ſome marke in the Tower, as</hi> b, <hi>which marke is iuſt leuell with the ſpring head</hi> a, <hi>to which place the water may bee brought by pypes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And if the ground lye reaſonable leuell, ſo that you conuey the water by trenches, order the ſaid trenches ſo by helpe of a plumbe, that the water may haue currant 4 ½ inches at euery miles end, then fill the gutter with pibble ſtones a foote or more deepe, and vpon them throw earth, ſo will the water run more cleere to the place appointed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Note laſtely, that it is beſt, if you bring your water by pipes,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Angle of poſition is ſuch an angle that is taken in reſpect of the needle or in reſpect of the South point, inſomuch that the one ſide of euery angle of poſition is the Néedle, and the 02 other the Alhidada, the common ſection of the termes of which angle alwaies concurre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very extrée of the Néedle, differing from ſtationary angles, becauſe they conteine the number of degrées, betwixt any two obiects, propoſed at euery particular ſtation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and the angles of poſition the number of degrées diſtant from the Meridian.</p>
               <p>To obſerue therefore an angle of poſition, you muſt place the Néedle ouer his true line in the bottome of the Boxe, the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſphere</hi> there reſting conuey the <hi>Alhidada</hi> with the ſights to the marke aſſigned, noting the degrées cut in the <hi>Planiſphere,</hi> for that is the angle of poſition, whereby you may ſee that the angle of poſition is not limited reſpectiuely, according as hee is right, acute, or obtuſe, but onely doth extend it ſelfe to any degrée in the whole circle, and therefore the termes of theſe angles might rather be called lines of poſition, in reſpect of their ſituation, and pointing into the ſeuerall parts of the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Now to protract the ſaid angles, the difference is not any from the worke in the laſt Chapter, onely where you beginne to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, call that point the South, &amp; ſo forward in the other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, according as you ſhall be directed by the letters <hi>SEWN,</hi> vpon the protractor ſignifying South, Eaſt, Weſt, North.</p>

                  <hi>Let the propoſition be to deſcribe England, and therein to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate ſuch townes as ſhall be required in that bigneſſe, as is here ſet downe according to my Scale: the firſt thing that I doe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing appointed my Card, I croſſe the ſame with two right lines at right angles, appointing at the end thereof the foure quarters of the world, as in the Type: then I find out ſome towne that I coniecture (by conference with my tables) lieth about the midſt of the land, which let (for examples ſake) be Middle Wiche, a towne ſituate in Cheſhire, the which towne I place vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interſection of the foreſaid lines, and thereby write the name of the ſame, ſearching in my tables for ſome other towne that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth direct Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South; I find none: therefore I take ſome other towne, as Briſtow, drawing a line according to the poſition of the ſame, getting alſo from your tables the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that towne from Middle Wiche, as 97 miles, to which wideneſſe vpon your Scale open the feete of your compaſſe, and then place that wideneſſe vpon the line of poſition for Briſtow, placing the one foote in the marke made for Middle Wiche, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a note with the other in the ſaid line of poſition, where write Briſtow. Theſe two townes ſo placed, let vs now go ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Northampton: firſt by my tables I finde the diſtance of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Wiche from Northampton, and according to that diſtance, the one foote reſting in the marke for Middle Wiche, with the other I ſtrike the portion of any arch: the like I doe with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Northampton from Briſtow, as in the 12 Chapter is plaine. Now the interſection of theſe two arches is the true place
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4422:51"/>of Northampton, where make a marke for the towne, and write the name thereof by the ſaid marke, and ſo proceed, limiting all the townes, ports, angles, and nookes in the Iſland in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, as you may ſufficiently gather by the former demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen you haue taken the plat of any countrey, and therein ſituated all the townes, ports, and ſuch like, yet happily ſhall it be expedient (or rather of you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) to ſeparate and diſtinguiſh the ſame into ſuch Prouinces, Shires, or Regiments, as the ſaid Kingdome is diuided into. So is England, or the South part of great Britanie, being a <hi>peninſula,</hi> diuided into <hi>52</hi> parts (but not equall parts) which we call Shires, then is euery Shire ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into other certaine vnequall parts (as Worceſter Shire into <hi>12</hi>) which be called Hundreds, either for that there were but at firſt ſo many townes or villages therein, or for that there is to be required <hi>100</hi> able men in euery of them. Other diuiſions is England yet ſubiect vnto; as firſt, the whole Kingdome is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Prouinces or Archbiſhoprickes, to wit Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Yorke, then theſe Prouinces are ſubdiuided into Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, and euery Biſhopricke is reſubdiuided into Pariſhes, according to which diuiſions I minde God willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Mappe of all England, &amp;c. But now the way how to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto theſe ſubdiuiſions is not knowne. It is therefore to be performed after two kind of waies: the firſt whereof is, you muſt in your Perambulation, as in the <hi>11</hi> and <hi>12</hi> Chapter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the bounds and limits of each prouince, &amp;c. euen as there you doe the townes, and to protract it accordingly, diſtinguiſhing the ſame with certaine pricked lines.</p>
               <p>The other way is, to find by ſome records what townes and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4422:52"/>ſuch like be the Meres and bounds of the ſaid Shires, &amp;c. The which hauing placed in your Mappe, the diuiſion is made by drawing certaine lines from towne to towne, or if your may be ſmall, hauing made a point for the place of the towne, you may omit to write the name thereof, and ſo draw certaine pricked lines from point to point. Euen as you may perceiue England in the enſuing Card diuided into Shires.</p>

But this Altitude is not as yet preciſe, by reaſon of the Sunnes parallax, therefore in the Table of parallaxes according to the 19 degree of Altitude, and according to the Sunnes threefold diſtance from the earth, finde the parts there ſet, to wit, 2 minutes, 44 ſec. theſe adde to the former Altitude corrected by the refraction, becauſe the parallax doth make the Sunne ſeeme lower then indeed he is, ſo haue you gotten his true and perfect Altitude, as well in reſpect of the refraction, as the paralax, to wit, 19 degrees 15 ¼ minutes which you obſerued inſtrumentally to be 19 degrees 17 ⅙ min.</p>
               <p>Hence commeth it that the Poles eleuation obſerued by the Meridian altitude of the Sunne or Starres, and by the Pole it ſelfe differ, if you conferre two of theſe Altitudes together.</p>

Sandy ground is right neceſſary for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a citty, and for the plat ground hereof, let it not bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together very leuell and plaine, but haue pleaſant aſcents, and riſing bankes, which will cauſe the citty to bee more pleaſant to the eye, healthfull to the body, and fitter for warlike defence, as it may be ſéene by old Rome. (which now lyeth ruinate) there were ſeuen ſuch hilles, in the head of the citty ſtood mount <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> towards the middeſt of the citty were two other mounts, called <hi>Palatine</hi> and <hi>Quirinal,</hi> vpon the left hand of the cittie was the mount <hi>Eſquiline,</hi> vpon the right hand <hi>Caelian,</hi> and towards the end of the citty were two other mounts called <hi>Viminall</hi> and <hi>Auentine,</hi> all which mounts much beautified the citty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were many ſports acted, where alſo was (and would be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citties) fit places to erect pyramides, or other ſuch citty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</p>

               <p>And if you would reduce the plat from a leſſer to a greater then the pencel next the center muſt alwaies kéepe the perimeter of the plat, and the other pencell ſhall deſcribe a greater figure proportionall to the leſſer, according to the quantity aſſigned.</p>
               <p>And in the reducing of mappes by this meanes may you giue prickes for the ſituation of all townes, villages, &amp;c. in the ſaid map, and thereby place them in your reduced map in their true place, for when your pencels be once placed at their true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you muſt neuer alter them vntill you haue finiſhed.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the falling of timber, you are beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the retyring of the ſappe to cut the timber trée round about, vntill you come néere vnto the end of the ſappe, and ſo leaue the trée growing vntill you ſée that the ſap hath all runne downe, and ceaſed dropping, whereby you haue purified the trée, and left no moyſture within to corrupt or putrifie the ſame: and that your timber may bee the more ſound, voyd of wormes, and without rifts and chaunes, let the ſame be fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time after Midſommer vntill the end of Ianuarie, eſpecially in the full moone, but not in wet and windie daies, leauing ſuch for no vſe but ſnell that were wind falles as well for that the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4422:102"/>timber is not permanent, as alſo for that Maſters in Aſtrologie ſay houſes built therewith be more ſubiect to danger in time of tempeſt.</p>
               <p>Now if you conuert any of this timber to boards, many vſe to throwe them into water, and there let them remaine <hi>14</hi> or <hi>15</hi> daies, ſo ſhall they be the ſooner ſeaſoned and better exempt from wormes.</p>

               <p>And in concluſion, of falling of great timber trees, one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing I would haue you to obſerue when you fall your trées, that is to crop of all the great armes and maſter boughes of the tree before you fall the ſame, becauſe moſt commonly they be the occaſion of the ſpoyling of much timber in the tree, and many times of moſt or all of the body of the tree, becauſe the great top of the trée falling with ſuch a waight, and pulling the reſt downe with ſuch a violence, much of the tree is ſhattered and rent, as many may ſée daily to their loſſe.</p>
